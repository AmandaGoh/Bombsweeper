Bomb Sweeper README - Read me first!

About Bomb Sweeper:
This game was modeled after the popular Windows Minesweeper game created by Curt Johnson and Robert Donner.

Instructions for Game Play:

- Aim of the game is not to be "blown up" by revealing all cells on the grid WITHOUT clicking on the cells containing bombs.
- Clicking on a cell will reveal a bomb, a clue or an empty cell.
- A cell with a clue will contain the numbers (1 to 8) which is a count of the total number of bombs lying underneath directly surrounding cells.
- To assist players on avoiding a bomb, the location of the suspected bomb may be marked by a flag (flag appears with the right clicking of the mouse).

Features of the Game:

- User can choose from an easy or hard difficulty level (default difficulty level is set to easy).
- Bombs are generated at random locations around the grid each time a new game begins.
- Right-click of mouse displays a flag which players can use to mark suspected cells containing bombs.
